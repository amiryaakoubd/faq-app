## Getting Started

I used Node version 18.18.2 to develop this project.

First, create a ".env" file in the root directory and fill in the correct values using .env.example as a template.

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

## Testing

You can run the tests using the following commands:

```bash
npm run test
```

or

```bash
npm run test:watch
```
